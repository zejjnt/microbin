# This is a fork of a fork of a fork of https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin

temp repo for merged fixes of Microbin until the original [maintainer be back](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/issues/249#issuecomment-1994209506) in the summer.

See the previous fork and closed pull requests to see what has been merged.

I don't use Docker so if things related to containers go stale, sorry not sorry :)
